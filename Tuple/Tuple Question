Consider the following list of tuples which represents the cost of a product, let’s say
it is a laptop, and the list has brand name, additional number of features added to it,
cost, and total tax on the product.
[(‘Dell’, 5, 60,000, 4% of the cost), (‘Vivo’, 4, 57,000, 5% of the cost), (‘HP’,
4, 59,000, 6% of the cost), (‘Samsung’, 3, 45,000, 3% of the cost)]
Perform the following operations:
a. Sort the list by increasing order of total price (cost + tax)
b. Sort the list by decreasing order of cost (without tax)
Note: conversion of list to tuple or tuple to list can be made wherever
necessary
c. Implement a function discount(), that takes Cost of a laptop and % of tax
applied on the product. The function discount should compute and return the
total cost. If the total cost is more than 60,000; then apply discount as 2% of
total cost and display the cost estimated else return “No Discount applied.
