You are an enthusiastic football player. Unfortunately, you are unable to
go and play it at your club. Confined to play in a room you decide to play
making your rules for your favourite game.

You decide that the central part of your room is the football ground which is
rectangular in shape, the goal posts on either side of the longest edges. The goal
post is also rectangular in shape.
Define a class called “Ball” which defines the position of the ball by using x,y
positions [x-coordinate, y-coordinate] and x, y which gives the amount
change in x-direction and y-direction respectively.
Define another class called “MyFavGame” which inherits the “Ball” class has
dimensions of ground, goal posts and has methods to move the ball in the
ground, into the posts and maintains score. You get a point if you move the ball
into the goal posts and lose a point if your ball moves out of the ground. Also give
yourself a minimum of 5 moves and print the score you get after that.

Add any other method/s which you feel are required.
